# Abaddon Vanilla
The backbone of my modpacks, this modpack is the base for large ones I intend to make. This is the largest foundation for them, it is based off of [Abaddon Client](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/abaddon-client) and is utilized as the base for [Abaddon Mines](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/abaddon-mines).
You can download [Journey's Gate](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/abaddon-vanilla) on CurseForge, others are not allowed to distribute, modify or release files from the modpack in any manner, unto others.
# Changelogs
I like my [changelogs](https://github.com/Apollonu/Abaddon-Client/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) to be extensive, if there are any errors for some reason, make an issue and I will fix it. Do not abuse the Pull request for any reason whatsoever.
